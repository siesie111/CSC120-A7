- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Inheritance help to reduce redundancy in rewriting same methods for different class. Inheritance also makes the codes more organized with the structure of which classes are the sub to the main class. Inheritance also helps me to reflect on how to make my codes more orgianzed and simplified, also gain a deeper understanding in terms of how to build an efficient coding habit. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance is great for making different code files more organized and efficient, but extra thinking on the relationship between different java files that are serving different purposes might cause the coding in general to be more challenging, since we really need to be clear about what we are trying to do with each individual file and what are the relationships between them.
